## Introduction

    Unemployment is one of the most widely discussed indicators of a country’s economic health and labor market efficiency. It reflects a country’s economic performance, stability, and the well-being of households, communities, and future workforce participants. In recent years, the U.S. labor market has undergone substantial changes as it continues to recover from the pandemic’s disruption and adjust to new patterns in remote work, automation, and sectoral demand. Understanding unemployment patterns across different demographic and educational groups provides valuable insight into how opportunities are distributed and which populations face persistent challenges in the job market.
    This research focuses on unemployment trends in the United States between 2020 and 2024, with particular attention to how education and gender influence employment outcomes. These factors are not only central to national labor policies but also directly relevant to college students entering the workforce for the first time. As many students navigate internships, job applications, and career planning, examining such patterns can offer a perspective on how education and demographic characteristics shape job prospects. Specifically, this paper investigates the following question:
    
    **(1) Did college graduates have a lower average unemployment rate than non-college graduates betweeen 2020 and 2024?**

## Data Summary

  The data for unemployment rates of both college graduates and high school graduates come from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, retrieved from an article from FRED (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis). The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects data through a mix of methods, including surveys sent to households and businesses, electronic data interchange for large firms, and computer-assisted telephone interviews, to gather a variety of data such as employment, wages, and consumer expenditures. The data, also known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), is collected and processed by BLS employees and contractors with strict policies to ensure the confidentiality of respondent information. Further, the data collected for the CPS is a monthly sample survey of around 60,000 households from across the United States; the Census Bureau selected eligible households based on certain steps. They first group all of the counties and independent cities in the U.S. into 2,000 geographic areas, and design and select a sample of around 800 areas (units) to represent each state (and D.C.); these areas are intended to reflect a various range, including urban and rural areas, as well as various industrial and farming regions. The Census Bureau does note that their sample excludes individuals living in institutions and those on active duty in the Armed Forces. However, overall, any person over the age of sixteen is eligible to be selected for the survey (“Current Population Survey”). 
  According to the Labor Force Statistics from the CPS, much of the data collected can often undergo seasonal adjustments to account for fluctuations over the course of year as a result of seasonal events. However, both of the datasets used for this paper have not undergone any form of seasonal adjustments. The data does experience modifications for population control. Specifically, the Census Bureau adjusts the CPS population controls to incorporate the latest information about population change, and these adjustments are incorporated into the CPS estimates for data in January (“Technical Documentation (CPS)”).
